Project: Applying Machine Learning Across Diverse Real-World Datasets üîç

I recently worked on an exciting machine learning project, where I applied unsupervised learning, regression, and classification techniques to analyze three diverse datasets:

Online Retail Data (Customer Segmentation)
Housing Prices (Price Prediction)
Heart Failure Prediction (Mortality Risk Classification)
Key Highlights:
üîπ Unsupervised Learning (Online Retail Data):
I used K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors. This helped identify key customer segments, which can inform better marketing and inventory management strategies.

üîπ Regression Analysis (Housing Prices):
Using regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, I predicted housing prices based on features such as square footage, location, and amenities. Gradient Boosting Regression delivered the highest accuracy in this analysis.

üîπ Classification (Heart Failure Prediction):
In the healthcare domain, I employed classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to predict heart failure mortality risk. Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 87.80%, contributing to potential early interventions and personalized healthcare.

Models and Techniques Used:
Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering, PCA
Regression Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Classification Algorithms: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, AdaBoost
Impact:
Improved customer segmentation for targeted marketing in retail.
Accurate housing price predictions for real estate insights.
Early heart failure risk prediction, aiding timely healthcare decisions.
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning to generate actionable insights and contribute to better decision-making across industries.
